Types of Linked Lists:

Type	                Structure
Singly Linked List	Each node points to the next node only
Doubly Linked List	Each node points to both next and previous nodes

Singly Linked List is simple and memory-efficient, good for forward traversal.


Analysis:

Operation	Time Complexity	   Reason
Add	        O(n)	           Traverse to end to insert
Search	        O(n)	           Linear search
Traverse	O(n)	           Visit all nodes
Delete	        O(n)	           Search + re-link nodes

Advantages of Linked Lists Over Arrays:

Feature	        Array	        Linked List
Size	        Fixed size	Dynamic size
Insert/Delete	Costly (O(n))	Efficient (O(1) at head)
Memory Use	Pre-allocated	Allocated on demand
Random Access	Fast (O(1)) 	Slow (O(n))
