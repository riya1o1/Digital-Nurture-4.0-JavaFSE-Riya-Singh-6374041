How Arrays are Represented in Memory
-Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations.
-Each element can be accessed using an index (0-based).
-The base address and index allow O(1) time access to any element.

Advantages of Arrays
-Fast access via index (O(1))
-Simple to declare and use
-Good for fixed-size collections where size is known in advance

Analysis
Operation	Time Complexity	Explanation
Add	        O(1)	        Insert at next index
Search	        O(n)	        Linear search through array
Traverse	O(n)	        Visit each element
Delete    	O(n)     	Search + shift elements after deletion

Limitations of Arrays
-Fixed Size:
Cannot dynamically grow beyond the declared size.
-Costly Deletion:
Requires shifting elements â†’ O(n)

When to Use Arrays:
-When the number of elements is known in advance
-When random access is frequently needed
-When memory allocation is limited and controlled
