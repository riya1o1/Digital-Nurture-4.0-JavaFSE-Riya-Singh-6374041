Why are Data Structures & Algorithms important here?

-Inventory systems need to search, add, update, and delete products efficiently.
-Proper data structures ensure fast access, low memory usage, and better scalability.
-Algorithms help optimize these operations for large-scale inventory.


Suitable Data Structures:

-ArrayList
-HashMap


Analysis:
Time Complexity (Using HashMap):

Operation      Time Complexity
Add	       O(1) average
Update	       O(1) average
Delete	       O(1) average
Display All    O(n)


Optimization Tips:
- Load factor tuning if performance degrades on very large inventories.
- For persistence, connect to a database instead of memory storage.
- Use ConcurrentHashMap for thread-safe operations in real-time environments.
