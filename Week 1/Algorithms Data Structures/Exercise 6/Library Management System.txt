Linear Search:
-Checks every element one by one until the target is found or list ends.
-Does not require sorted data.
-Time Complexity:
-Best case: O(1)
-Average/Worst case: O(n)


Binary Search:
-Works on sorted data.
-Repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
-Time Complexity:
-Best case: O(1)
-Average/Worst case: O(log n)
